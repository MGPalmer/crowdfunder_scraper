# crowdfunder_scraper

This is a small library to scrape data off a (to be unnamed) crowdfunding website. The code is here mostly for instructional purposes.

Please see the accompanying blog posts: https://monogreen.home.blog/2019/11/05/scraping-a-crowd-funding-platform-for-fun-and-non-profit-part-1/

Any feedback welcome! Find me on monogreen.de or here on Github.
